- **host_id:** Foreign Key to User
- **title:** Property name/title
- **price_per_night:** Nightly rate
- **location:** Property address/coordinates

**Relations:** A property belongs to one user (host). A property can have multiple bookings and multiple reviews.

#### Booking

- **booking_id:** Unique identifier (Primary Key)
- **property_id:** Foreign Key to Property
- **user_id:** Foreign Key to User (guest)
- **check_in_date:** Start date of booking
- **check_out_date:** End date of booking
- **status:** Booking status (pending, confirmed, cancelled)

**Relations:** A booking belongs to one property and one user (guest). A booking is associated with one payment.

#### Review

- **review_id:** Unique identifier (Primary Key)
- **property_id:** Foreign Key to Property
- **user_id:** Foreign Key to User
- **rating:** Numeric rating (1-5)
- **comment:** Review text

**Relations:** A review belongs to one property and one user. Each booking can optionally have one review.

#### Payment

- **payment_id:** Unique identifier (Primary Key)
- **booking_id:** Foreign Key to Booking
- **amount:** Payment amount
- **payment_method:** Payment type (credit card, PayPal, etc.)
- **transaction_date:** Timestamp of payment

**Relations:** A payment belongs to one booking. Each booking has one associated payment.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management

- Provides secure user registration, authentication, and profile management capabilities. Users can create accounts, log in with encrypted credentials, and manage their personal information. This feature ensures that both guests and hosts have personalized and secure access to the platform.

### Property Management

- Enables hosts to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings with detailed information. Each property includes essential details like title, description, location, pricing, and amenities. This feature forms the core inventory of the platform, allowing hosts to showcase their properties to potential guests.

### Booking System

- Allows guests to reserve properties by selecting check-in and check-out dates and managing booking details. The system tracks booking status (pending, confirmed, cancelled) and prevents double-bookings. This feature facilitates the primary transaction flow between guests and hosts.

### Payment Processing

- Handles secure payment transactions related to bookings and records payment details for accountability. Integrates with payment gateways to process various payment methods and ensures financial transactions are tracked. This feature enables monetization and builds trust through secure payment handling.

### Review System

- Allows guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties they have booked. Reviews include numeric ratings and text comments that help future guests make informed decisions. This feature builds community trust and provides valuable feedback to hosts for improving their offerings.

### API Documentation

- Provides comprehensive documentation using OpenAPI standard for REST APIs and GraphQL schema definitions. Clear documentation ensures easy integration for frontend developers and third-party services. This feature accelerates development and reduces integration errors.

### Database Optimization

- Implements indexing strategies for frequently accessed data and caching mechanisms to reduce database load. Optimizations improve query performance and overall system responsiveness. This feature ensures the platform can scale efficiently as user and data volume grows.

## API Security

### Authentication

- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints. This prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and personal information, maintaining the integrity of the platform.

### Authorization

- Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures users can only perform actions appropriate to their role (guest, host, admin). Hosts can only modify their own properties, and guests can only manage their own bookings. This prevents privilege escalation and protects against unauthorized data manipulation.

### Data Encryption

- Sensitive data such as passwords are hashed using secure algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2), and HTTPS/TLS encrypts data in transit. Payment information is tokenized and never stored directly. This protects user credentials and financial data from breaches and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Rate Limiting

- API rate limiting prevents abuse by restricting the number of requests a user can make within a time window. This protects the system from DDoS attacks, brute-force login attempts, and excessive resource consumption. Rate limiting ensures fair usage and maintains system availability.

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS attacks, and other malicious payloads. Django's built-in protections and additional validation layers ensure data integrity. This is crucial for protecting the database and preventing security vulnerabilities.

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

- Properly configured CORS policies control which domains can access the API. This prevents unauthorized websites from making requests on behalf of users. CORS protection is essential for preventing CSRF attacks and maintaining API security.

## CI/CD Pipeline

- CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes. This ensures that new features and bug fixes are automatically validated and deployed to production with minimal manual intervention, reducing human error and accelerating development cycles.

### Importance

- CI/CD is crucial for maintaining code quality, catching bugs early, and ensuring consistent deployments across environments. Automated testing prevents broken code from reaching production, while automated deployment reduces downtime and enables faster iteration. This approach supports agile development and maintains system stability.

### Tools & Implementation

- **GitHub Actions:** Automates workflows for running tests, linting code, and triggering deployments on every push or pull request. Provides seamless integration with GitHub repositories.

- **Docker:** Containerizes the application to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production. Docker images are built automatically and pushed to container registries.

- **Testing Frameworks:** Pytest for unit and integration tests, ensuring code functionality is verified before deployment.

- **Deployment Platforms:** AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean for hosting, with automated deployment scripts triggered by the CI/CD pipeline.
