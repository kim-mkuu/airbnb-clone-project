# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview

The **Airbnb Clone Project** aims to replicate the core functionality of Airbnb by building a robust backend that manages users, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.

- CRUD operations for property listings  
- Booking system with check-in/check-out management  
- Payment processing and transaction recording
